# Contributing guide

## Compiling with SQLCipher encryption enabled

Add `cabal.project.local` to project root with the location of OpenSSL headers and libraries and flag setting encryption mode:

```
cp scripts/cabal.project.local.mac cabal.project.local
# or
# cp scripts/cabal.project.local.linux cabal.project.local
```

## OpenSSL on MacOS

MacOS comes with LibreSSL as default, OpenSSL must be installed to compile SimpleX from source.

OpenSSL can be installed with `brew install openssl@1.1`

You will have to add `/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1/bin` to your PATH in order to have things working properly


## Project branches

**In simplex-chat repo**

- `stable` - stable release of the apps, can be used for updates to the previous stable release (GHC 9.6.2).

- `stable-android` - used to build stable Android core library with Nix (GHC 8.10.7).

- `stable-ios` - used to build stable iOS core library with Nix (GHC 8.10.7) â€“ this branch should be the same as `stable-android` except Nix configuration files.

- `master` - branch for beta version releases (GHC 9.6.2).

- `master-ghc8107` - branch for beta version releases (GHC 8.10.7).

- `master-android` - used to build beta Android core library with Nix (GHC 8.10.7), same as `master-ghc8107`

- `master-ios` - used to build beta iOS core library with Nix (GHC 8.10.7).

- `windows-ghc8107` - branch for windows core library build (GHC 8.10.7).

`master-ios` and `windows-ghc8107` branches should be the same as `master-ghc8107` except Nix configuration files.

**In simplexmq repo**

- `master` - uses GHC 9.6.2 its commit should be used in `master` branch of simplex-chat repo.

- `master-ghc8107` - its commit should be used in `master-android` (and `master-ios`) branch of simplex-chat repo.

## Development & release process

1. Make PRs to `master` branch _only_ for both simplex-chat and simplexmq repos.

2. If simplexmq repo was changed, to build mobile core libraries you need to merge its `master` branch into `master-ghc8107` branch.

3. To build core libraries for Android, iOS and windows:
- merge `master` branch to `master-ghc8107` branch.
- update `simplexmq` commit in `master-ghc8107` branch to the commit in `master-ghc8107` branch (probably, when resolving merge conflicts).
- update code to be compatible with GHC 8.10.7 (see below).
- push to GitHub.

4. To build Android core library, merge `master-ghc8107` branch to `master-android` branch, and push to GitHub.

5. To build iOS core library, merge `master-ghc8107` branch to `master-ios` branch, and push to GitHub.

6. To build windows core library, merge `master-ghc8107` branch to `windows-ghc8107` branch, and push to GitHub.

7. To build Desktop and CLI apps, make tag in `master` branch, APK files should be attached to the release.

8. After the public release to App Store and Play Store, merge:
- `master` to `stable`
- `master` to `master-ghc8107` (and compile/update code)
- `master-ghc8107` to `master-android`
- `master-ghc8107` to `master-ios`
- `master-ghc8107` to `windows-ghc8107`
- `master-android` to `stable-android`
- `master-ios` to `stable-ios`

9. Independently, `master` branch of simplexmq repo should be merged to `stable` branch on stable releases.


## Differences between GHC 8.10.7 and GHC 9.6.2

1. The main difference is related to `DuplicateRecordFields` extension.

It is no longer possible in GHC 9.6.2 to specify type when using selectors, instead OverloadedRecordDot extension and syntax are used that need to be removed in GHC 8.10.7:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DuplicateRecordFields #-}
-- use this in GHC 9.6.2 when needed
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedRecordDot #-}

-- GHC 9.6.2 syntax
let x = record.field

-- GHC 8.10.7 syntax removed in GHC 9.6.2
let x = field (record :: Record)
```

It is still possible to specify type when using record update syntax, use this pragma to suppress compiler warning:

```haskell
-- use this in GHC 9.6.2 when needed
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-warn-ambiguous-fields #-}

let r' = (record :: Record) {field = value}
```

2. Most monad functions now have to be imported from `Control.Monad`, and not from specific monad modules (e.g. `Control.Monad.Except`).

```haskell
-- use this in GHC 9.6.2 when needed
import Control.Monad
```

[This PR](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/pull/2975/files) has all the differences.
