# Join SimpleX Chat team

SimpleX Chat Ltd is a seed stage startup with a lot of user growth in 2022-2023, and a lot of exciting technical and product problems to solve to grow faster.

We currently have 4 full-time people in the team - all engineers, including the founder.

We want to add up to 3 people to the team. 


## Who we are looking for

### Systems Haskell engineer

You are a servers/network/Haskell expert:
- network libraries.
- exception handling, concurrency, STM.
- type systems - we use ad hoc dependent types a lot.
- strictness.
- has some expertise in network protocols, cryptography and general information security principles and approaches.
- interested to build the next generation of messaging network.

You will be focussed mostly on our servers code, and will also contribute to the core client code written in Haskell. 


### Product engineer (iOS)

You are a product UX expert who designs great user experiences directly in iOS code:
- iOS and Mac platforms, including:
  - SwiftUI and UIKit.
  - extensions, including notification service extension and sharing extension.
  - low level inter-process communication primitives for concurrency.
- interested about creating the next generation of UX for a communication/social network.

Knowledge of Android and Kotlin Multiplatform would be a bonus - we use Kotlin Jetpack Compose for our Android and desktop apps.


## About you

- **Passionate about joining SimpleX Chat team**:
  - already use SimpleX Chat to communicate with friends/family or participate in public SimpleX Chat groups.
  - passionate about privacy, security and communications.
  - interested to make contributions to SimpleX Chat open-source project in your free time before we hire you, as an extended test.

- **Exceptionally pragmatic, very fast and customer-focussed**:
  - care about the customers (aka users) and about the product we build much more than about the code quality, technology stack, etc.
  - believe that the simplest solution is the best.
  - 2-3x faster than the most competent people you worked with.
  - focus on solving only today's problems and resist engineering for the future (aka over-engineering) – see [The Duct Tape Programmer](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/) and [Why I Hate Frameworks](https://medium.com/@johnfliu/why-i-hate-frameworks-6af8cbadba42).
  - do not suffer from "not invented here" syndrome, at the same time interested to design and implement protocols and systems from the ground up when appropriate.

- **Love software engineering**:
  - have 5y+ of software engineering experience in complex projects, 
  - great understanding of the common principles:
    - data structures, bits and byte manipulation
    - text encoding and manipulation
    - software design and algorithms
    - concurrency
    - networking

- **Want to join a very early stage startup**:
  - high pace and intensity, longer hours.
  - a substantial part of the compensation is stock options.
  - full transparency – we believe that too much [autonomy](https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/851459129830850561) hurts learning and slows down progress.
